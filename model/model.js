<h1>What's Kpop?</h1>
<div class="image-One"></div>
<P>Kpop is Korean popular music. It is mainstream music that originated from South Korea. Korean pop music in Korea could be thought of as similar to Taylor Swift in the United States.</P>
<p>The term Kpop includes many different musical genres under its umbrella. Along with Korean pop, it can also include rock, hip hop, and electronic music. Kpop is considered a fairly new form of music. The type of K-Pop music that you’re listening to today was formed around the 1990s. The roots for K-Pop began from the 1950s, however, and have since then already been influenced a lot by different types of Western music and pop groups. American pop culture has especially had – and still does have – an effect on K-Pop.</p>
<h1>What was the very first Kpop group?</h1>
<div class="image-Two"></div>
<P>Unlike other musical genres, contemporary Kpop start can be pinpointed to a certain date: April 11th of 1992, when the groups Seo Taiji and The Boys performed their music on TV for the first time. This was the driving force that also led to the formation of all your favorite idol groups, with SM Entertainment being established in 1995, JYP Entertainment in 1997, and YG Entertainment in 1998. The very first K-Pop idol group to exist was H.O.T., which debuted in 1996.</p>

<P> The apparent suicides of two female K-pop stars in less than two months have revealed a darker side. First, in October, 25-year-old Choi Jin-ri, known as Sulli. Then, in November, her close friend, 28-year-old Goo Hara.   Together they amassed hundreds of millions of views on their music videos. But despite their international fame, both women were long-time targets of cyberbullying. <br>
In K-pop, perfection is a must — in discipline, performance and in looks. No one understands that better than K-pop artist Amber Liu, who says there is an expectation in the industry to be perfect. <br>
"If you aren't under a certain weight, you can definitely get cut," Liu said. "You're told what to do, what to say, what to think."
Liu was Sulli's former bandmate and friend. She says she's seen the toll the cutthroat industry, combined with cyberbullying, can take. 
"When [people] hear you're getting help they're like, 'What? Why are you getting help? That's weird.' And that stigma against mental health is just so strong," Liu said.<br></p>
<p>
There's a nationwide mental health crisis in South Korea, where the subject is still taboo and there's limited resources for those seeking help. According to the World Health Organization, South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates of any country, nearly double the U.S.
Sulli, who died in October, was an outspoken mental health activist and feminist, an anomaly in the industry.  
Aging is yet another stress. K-pop stars already have a short shelf life — retirement age is 30 if not earlier.
And young rising idols, like Alexaundra Christine Schneiderman, who performs under the stage name Alexa, can add to that. 
"They're called idols, because they're put on this pedestal of kind of like untouchable perfection I guess in the public's eyes, in the consumers' eyes," Alexa said.</p>

<h1>What are Kpop Idols?</h1>
<div class="artist-One"></div>
<P>Kpop idols are groups and artists formed by the various entertainment companies creating catchy Korean popular music and targeting younger audiences. The music groups are formed from a group of people who are all particularly talented in at least one of the following: singing, rapping, and dancing. These idols often enter the entertainment company in their teens and then train hard for years in areas like singing, rapping, dancing, and foreign languages. Then, if they are lucky and talented enough, by the end of their teens they will be picked for an idol group.</P>
<p> The Kpop groups then periodically come out with music singles and albums filled with catchy tunes. Every week they’ll go to many music shows to perform their lead single, for a period of one month to two months. Although the song is important, special care and attention are always put into styling the group members, a well-synched choreography, and a high-quality music video.
This combination tells the story of the chosen style concept for each era. Some could say these entertainment companies work like manufacturers in assembling the perfect idol group outlook and style for each cycle of performing and promoting the music.</p>
<h1>Most Popular Boy Band</h1>
<div class="artist-Two"></div>
<P>This seven-member boy band has taken the world by storm and are definitely the biggest name in K-pop. BTS have performed sell-out arena shows across the US and UK, have achieved two No. 1 albums in the US, boast 16 million monthly listeners on Spotify, have sold 16 million albums (Map of Soul is the best-selling album in Korean history), and were the best-selling artist to debut in the 2010s. According to the IFPI's Global Artist Chart, BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 (behind Drake), as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The seven members are rappers Suga, RM and J-hope, and vocalists Jimin, V, Jin and Jungkook.</p>
<p>  In August 2020, BTS released the track 'Dynamite', their first song entirely in English, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and stayed there for three whole weeks. It was the band's first No.1 single in the US and made BTS the first all-South Korean act to top the Hot 100.</p>
<h1>Most Popular Girl Group</h1>
<div class="artist-Three"></div>
<P> Consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa, Blackpink is another hugely successful Seoul-born girl group. In November 2019, they became the first ever K-pop band to join YouTube's 'billion views club', when their single Ddu-Du Ddu-Du was played more than a billion times on the site. The only other Korean act to join the club is Psy with Gangnam Style (remember that?). Blackpink also recently finished their In Your Area tour, which saw them perform to a total audience of around 205,000 people.

<h1>What's Kpop Merchandise?</h1>
<div class="merchandise-One"></div>
<P>Merchandise has become an integral part of the KPop business. Many fans are supporting their favorite artists not only by listening to their music but also by purchasing the things they release. Aside from albums that obviously everyone is aware of there are plenty of other collectibles designed to please us. As the music from South Korea is more and more recognizable worldwide the market is becoming bigger.<br>
We offer information about a selection of the most popular KPop merchandise and apparel including albums and hoodies that we found interesting and worth of introducing to the broader audience. We tried to cover every important Korean groups and solo artists including Wanna One and Stray Kids. You can find here a big range of official and fan made items. From more expensive to very affordable.</P>
<p> The best way to get some information is keeping in touch with official statements released by the agencies of the artists on their social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Browsing the Internet is of course crucial - you should always check the stores of the sellers you follow on Ebay and Amazon. The official shops of KPop groups are frequently updated so you should definitely add them to your bookmarks. The entertainment companies frequently come back with new merchandise collections. The most active are arguably YG Entertainment and SM Entertainment. YG always try to bring us a line related to their every big artists like Big Bang or BlackPink. SM's products are often displayed and sold at the COEX Artium complex they manage. It is located in Gangnam-gu in Seoul and is one of the main travel destinations of domestic and international fans. We should not forget about Big Hit Entertainment and the effort they make to satisfy the fans of Bangtan Boys. On their recently opened Big Hit Shop website you can easily get official items like phone cases, wrist bands and even portable powerbanks.

</p>
<div class="merchandise-Two"></div>
<P>Sometimes the price is the most crucial factor when choosing a new item. Collecting KPop merchandise can be very expensive if one's buying without putting too much thought into it. In some cases it is better to get something more affordable and save some money. Maybe it's even better to get many cheaper products instead of only one expensive. Everything comes to the quality. There are many unofficial things you'll be interested in even if you don't have a big budget. A set of lomo cards of the band you like are a perfect solution for such a problem. It can bring a big satisfaction without spending too much of your precious money.

<P> One of the biggest part of every KPop merch collector life are concert goods. These are intended for everyone who gets the ticket for a concert of a particular group. They can be bought at a later time online if available and if the manufacturer wills to continue providing it. The example of these kind of products can be a light stick that's created especially to use it during the concert but it can be also a cool item to have in your collection. The second example is a slogan with a name of the group often with a title of the tour you're attending to. Probably every popular KPop group has them. A cheaper alternative is a slogan made by fans. It's as well made as the official and you wouldn't see any difference. The third item you shouldn't forget is a fashionable clothes. Of course with a logo of a band you're supporting. And it's the best way for example to tell others what your bias is. As in the previous case it shouldn't be difficult to find something stylish on other websites than those official.  </p>

<h1>What are the requirment for Kpop Idols?</h1>
<div class="contact-One"></div>
<h2>Start voice and dance training at an early age.</h2>
<P>You can audition as early as 12 years old. Therefore it is recommended to get a full two years of experience in dancing and voice training before auditioning. That means at the earliest you should be training at age 10. If you are under 14, a legal guardian will need to accompany you for your audition. The average age of those that audition is 18 years old (ranges from 12-25 years old). Still, this means you should start training at age 16 at the latest. <br> Voice training has a lot to do with knowing how to breathe and finding your range. There are 7 main ranges:
<li>Soprano</li>
<li> Baritone</li>
<li>Bass</li>
<li> Mezzo-Soprano</li>
<li>Alto</li>
<li>Countertenor</li>
<li>Tenor</li>
</P>

<p> We recommend focusing on dancing as most interested in entering K-pop can sing or rap. Your focus should be on hip hop, contemporary, and urban dancing. For those that do not have the funds to take Kpop dancing lessons, there are hundreds of dance tutorials online that can help you. Commit to at least 30 hrs a week on becoming a more versatile dancer. One producer said that they would take a great dancer over a great singer any day. In Kpop, performance on stage is very important. It is very common for the songs to be pre-recorded so the group can solely focus on the choreography of their live performance. This is why so much emphasis is put on one’s dancing ability. </p>
<p>Try to learn the basic phrases in the beginning and while you train in Korean you will quickly be able to pick up the Korean language. You will be performing many Korean songs and be surrounded by many Korean trainees. Therefore preparing by studying Korean beforehand will be very helpful. There are many Korean educational apps you can use to make this process easier. In addition, try watching some of the best Korean dramas and Korean movies. In about a year, you will be able to speak and understand Korean at a basic level. 
</p>
<p>K-pop entertainment companies realize that personality goes a long way in building a group’s fanbase. All will have to go on Korean variety shows and this is where personality goes a long way. A great way to work on your personality is to watch K-pop idol interviews and prepare yourself with the typical questions that might come your way. Another way is to have a few prepared funny/interesting stories ready. Think of it as storytelling and the more you tell it, the more feedback you will get to try and improve it.</p>

<h1>Applying for K-pop Reality Shows.</h1>
<div class="contact-Three"></div>
<P> Another method on how to be a K-pop star would be to audition for K-pop reality shows. Many might not realize this but Big Bang, Twice, and Wanna One all came from K-pop Idol reality shows. These shows not only showcased their skills but also shared their day-to-day schedule with the audience from the moment they began their training to their debut. <br>
The top channel in Korea is Mnet which is Korea’s version of MTV. When auditioning for these programs, your “story” goes a long way in you getting on their program. Since they are first a TV show, they want to showcase your story more than your talent. Make sure you have a compelling story when applying to these K-pop reality shows.  </p>
<h2>Some of their K-pop reality shows on Mnet are listed below.</h2>

    <li> Produce101</li>
    <li>Produce X 101</li>
    <li>Queendom</li>
    <li>Produce 48</li>
    <li>Superstar K</li>
    <li>Show me the money</li>
    <li>Girls from Abroad</li>
    <br>  
    <p> SBS also has its own Kpop reality show called Kpop Star. The show brought judges from SM, JYP, YG, and a producer from Kpop Star. Therefore for the audition, you won’t be judged by one of these 4 judges or a representative for them. 
        
    KBS2 – The Unit is an Idol Rebooting Project where idols who have already debuted are given a second chance to showcase their talents to form another male or female group.
    <br>
    
    Naver V Live/ Naver TV – Exo’s “Heart 4 U” was one of the first idol reality shows to completely break free from the TV platform and was only released through Naver V Live and Naver TV.
    
    There are a lot of reasons to choose online platforms like YouTube over traditional TV channels. In the past, TV channels were the one and only option for many K-pop artists and groups. Then online platforms became an additional option, and it’s finally taken over as the more preferable option. It is a lot more flexible not only in the initial planning stages but also after the content has been posted to export to overseas platforms. In addition, audiences all around the world can log on much easier. Therefore this will lead to a larger global exposure, something BTS has been able to do very well. BTS used these platforms to communicate with their fans.</p>
